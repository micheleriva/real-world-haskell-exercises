# ðŸ”­ Real World Haskell Exercises

I am currently studying the Haskell programming languages with the famous "**Real World Haskell**" book. <br />
I'll put here my exercises 'cause I'd like to see if there are other ways to do them!

I made a simple Makefile just to be able to run my exercises from my main directory:

```sh
$ make run <exercise number>
```

Example:

```sh
$ make run 01
# > result
```

# Index

[01](/src/01/main.hs)
